# Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this repository I have collected various machine learning algorithms and attempted to code them from scratch using python and numpy. By doing so I have further increased my knowledge in the subject and improved my understanding of the mathematics behind machine learning. I have divided the repository into the following categories:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Supervised Learning**
- Regression
- Classification

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Association Rule Learning

**Model Optimisation**
- Model Assessment
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Ensemble Methods

**Deep Learning**
- Feed Forward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing and Recurrent Neural Networks
- Representation and Generative Learning

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Genetic Algorithms
- Markov Processes
